I designed my tweet class with 2 instance variables,
one for the name of the author and one for the content of the text.

I then wrote to methods, one to set the author and content of a new instance
of the Tweet class, and another to print the content and the author.

I wrote some test code in my main method to make sure the code worked
as intended.
