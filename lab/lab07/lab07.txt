1) This is divide and conquor algorithm in that it keeps dividing the 
data set in half.

2) The larger the set, the more times the program will likely have to 
divide the overall data set in half. It will do this less than N times,
though N does affect the amount of times it will have to be done.
I believe it operates in theta(log n) time.
