Task B.1

A two-dimensional array of integers should include the basic operations
- insert new integers into the list
- print itself
- tell the user if there is still room (in this case placeholder 0 values) 
- It should return the number of integers it can store
- It should be able to remove an integer from the list, in this case 
replacing it with a zero
