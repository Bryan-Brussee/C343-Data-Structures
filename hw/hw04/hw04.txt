1) The BST property is defined so that nodes with equal values are 
stored in the right subtree only so that they can be found in binary searches.
If they were stored in either the right or left subtree, they would be 
difficult to find; an algorithm would need to search both subtrees or choose
one randomly and risk missing the desired node. Making a node of equal value to
its parent the right subtree also maintains the invariablity of the BST by
codifying exactly how to maintain the order of nodes even when a child node
shares as value as its parent.

2) a)                     15
                         /  \		        
		        5    20
		         \   / \
		          7 18 25
		            /
                           16
   b) Preorder: 15(7), 5(2), 7(1), 20(4), 18(2), 16(1), 25(1)
      Inorder: 5(2), 7(1), 15(7), 16(1), 18(2), 20(4), 25(1)
      Postorder: 7(1), 5(2), 16(1), 18(2), 25(1), 20(4), 15(7)

3) In a max heap, a parent node is greater than or equal to its children.
Thus, the smallest element in a max heap must be stored in a leaf node.
